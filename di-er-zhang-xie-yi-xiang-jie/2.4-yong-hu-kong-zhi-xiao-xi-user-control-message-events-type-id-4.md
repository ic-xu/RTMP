# 2.4、用户控制消息User Control Message Events （type ID = 4）

User Control Message Events（用户控制消息，Message Type ID = 4）：告知对方执行该信息中包含的用户控制事件，比如Stream Begin 事件告知对方流信息开始传输。和前面提到的协议控制信息（Protocol Control Message）不同，用户控制消息是在 RTMP 协议层的，而不是在 RTMP chunk 流协议层，这个很容易弄混。该信息在 chunk 流中发送时，Message Stream ID = 0，Chunk Strean id = 2，Message type id = 4.

用户控制消息应该使用 0 作为消息流 ID，当通过 RTMP 块流发送此消息时，块流 ID 为 2. RTMP 流中的用户控制消息在接收 时立即生效，消息中的时间戳被忽略。

客户端或服务器发送此消息用来通知对方用户控制事件。此消息包含事件类型和事件数据。

```java
    +------------------------------+------------------------
    |     Event Type (16 bits)     | Event Data
    +------------------------------+-------------------------
         Payload for the ‘User Control’ protocol message
```

用户控制消息的前 2 个字节数据用来标识事件类型。事件类型后面是事件数据。事件数据字段是可变的。由于此消息是通过RTMP 块流层发送的，块大小的最大值应该满足在一个块里包含此消息。

用户控制事件支持如下类型：

```java
    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
    |     Event     |                   Description                    |
    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
    |Stream Begin   | The server sends this event to notify the client |
    |        (=0)   | that a stream has become functional and can be   |
    |               | used for communication. By default, this event   |
    |               | is sent on ID 0 after the application connect    |
    |               | command is successfully received from the        |
    |               | client. The event data is 4-byte and represents  |
    |               | the stream ID of the stream that became          |
    |               | functional.                                      |
    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
    | Stream EOF    | The server sends this event to notify the client |
    |        (=1)   | that the playback of data is over as requested   |
    |               | on this stream. No more data is sent without     |
    |               | issuing additional commands. The client discards |
    |               | the messages received for the stream. The        |
    |               | 4 bytes of event data represent the ID of the    |
    |               | stream on which playback has ended.              |
    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
    |  StreamDry    | The server sends this event to notify the client |
    |      (=2)     | that there is no more data on the stream. If the |
    |               | server does not detect any message for a time    |
    |               | period, it can notify the subscribed clients     |
    |               | that the stream is dry. The 4 bytes of event     |
    |               | data represent the stream ID of the dry stream.  |
    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
    |  SetBuffer    | The client sends this event to inform the server |
    |  Length (=3)  | of the buffer size (in milliseconds) that is     |
    |               | used to buffer any data coming over a stream.    |
    |               | This event is sent before the server starts      |
    |               | processing the stream. The first 4 bytes of the  |
    |               | event data represent the stream ID and the next  |
    |               | 4 bytes represent the buffer length, in          |
    |               | milliseconds.                                    |
    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
    | StreamIs      | The server sends this event to notify the client |
    | Recorded (=4) | that the stream is a recorded stream. The        |
    |               | 4 bytes event data represent the stream ID of    |
    |               | the recorded stream.                             |
    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
    |  PingRequest  | The server sends this event to test whether the  |
    |       (=6)    | client is reachable. Event data is a 4-byte      |
    |               | timestamp, representing the local server time    |
    |               | when the server dispatched the command. The      |
    |               | client responds with PingResponse on receiving   |
    |               | MsgPingRequest.                                  |
    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
    |  PingResponse | The client sends this event to the server in     |
    |        (=7)   | response to the ping request. The event data is  |
    |               | a 4-byte timestamp, which was received with the  |
    |               | PingRequest request.                             |
    +---------------+--------------------------------------------------+
